# üöÄ Envisioning the Future: Real-time Situational Awareness for Optimized Emergency Response System

## üîç Description

This project aims to provide real-time image and video analysis using state-of-the-art deep learning model. It enables users to analyze images and videos to detect various objects, such as fire, smoke, accidents, etc., using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm.

## ‚ú® Features

‚ú® **Image Analysis**: Upload an image and get predictions for objects detected within the image.

‚ú® **Video Analysis**: Upload a video and get predictions for objects detected within each frame of the video.
